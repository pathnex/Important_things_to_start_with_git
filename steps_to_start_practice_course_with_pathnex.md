Inside Timings:
echo "Today’s timing log" > Timings/Day01-06-Dec-2025.txt
Inside Coding Practice:
echo "My practice notes/code" > "Coding Practice/Day01-06-Dec-2025.txt"
🎉 Folder structure:
Batch_Name_Pathnex/
 ├── Timings/
 │     └── Day01-06-Dec-2025.txt
 └── Coding Practice/
       └── Day01-06-Dec-2025.txt
